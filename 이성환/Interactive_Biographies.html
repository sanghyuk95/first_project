            <h2>1930-1948</h2>
            <h1>Birth and Early Years on the Île d’Oléron</h1>
            <p>
              Pierre Bergé was born on the Île d'Oléron on November 14, 1930. His mother was a schoolteacher, and his father was a
              civil servant. He took an early interest in music and literature, which would go on to become lifelong passions. As a
              child, his mother—herself an amateur soprano—had him take violin lessons. What would become his ongoing affinity for
              great writers first emerged when he read Charles Dickens’s David Copperfield at the age of 9.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              After briefly moving to Lisieux, his family settled in La Rochelle, where Bergé attended high school. A few weeks after
              receiving his diploma, he decided to pursue a career in journalism and left La Rochelle for Paris, against his parents’
              wishes that he continue his studies.

            <h2>1936-1954</h2>
            <h1>Childhood in Oran</h1>
            <p>
              Yves Mathieu-Saint-Laurent was born in Oran, Algeria, on August 1, 1936. He was the son of Lucienne and Charles
              Mathieu-Saint-Laurent, manager of an insurance company and owner of a chain of cinemas. Yves and his sisters Michèle and
              Brigitte grew up among the society people of Oran.
            </p>
            <p>
              While still a schoolboy, the shy and sensitive Saint Laurent was an avid reader of literary works and his mother’s
              fashion magazines.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <i>Oran, not Paris, was our world at the time. Nor was it Algiers, Camus’s metaphysical city with its stark truths, or
              Marrakech, with its beneficial pink magic. Oran, a cosmopolitan place made up of merchants from everywhere and
              especially somewhere else, was a city that sparkled in a multicolored patchwork under the calm North African sun.</i>

            <h2>1948-1950</h2>
            <h1>Encounters and Early Convictions</h1>
            <p>
              Pierre Bergé moved to Paris and worked as a book dealer specializing in first editions. “I owe my first job to Richard
              Anacréon,” he recalled (Les jours s’en vont, je demeure). He soon met the major literary figures of that time, including
              Jean Giono, Jean Cocteau, Louis Aragon, Jean-Paul Sartre, and André Breton.
            </p>
            <p>
              His political convictions led him to become the editor-in-chief of the journal La Patrie mondiale, dedicated to
              supporting Garry Davis and his World Citizens movement. Davis campaigned for a world without borders and national
              distinctions, which he saw as the source of particularly intense conflict following World War II.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <i>Today it is difficult to imagine the fervor surrounding Garry Davis. We organized a number of meetings at which Sartre,
              Camus, Breton, Queneau, and many others spoke. I remember one evening at the Vél d’Hiv’, which was still there at the
              time. A jam-packed room gave Garry a standing ovation.</i>
